                        <p>In software engineering, quality is a necessity. Errors and defects can lead to anything from minor inconveniences to catastrophic failures. <strong>Software Reviews</strong> function as critical checkpoints throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (<span class="term">SDLC</span>) to validate work products like requirements, design documents, source code, and test cases.</p>
                        <p>A review brings together multiple perspectives to identify improvements, confirm work that meets expectations, and achieve predictable technical quality.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Reviews are Essential:</strong> Software reviews are critical checkpoints to find and fix defects early, which is significantly cheaper than finding them later in the SDLC.</li>
                        <li><strong>FTR vs. PME:</strong> A Formal Technical Review (FTR) focuses on a *specific work product* (like code or a design document) to find defects, while a Post-Mortem Evaluation (PME) reviews the *entire project* after completion to learn lessons for the future.</li>
                        <li><strong>SQA is Proactive:</strong> Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a broad set of activities that includes enforcing standards, conducting reviews, and managing risk to ensure quality is built into the process, not just tested at the end.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statistical SQA uses Data:</strong> This approach collects defect data, traces defects to their root causes, and applies the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to focus improvement efforts on the "vital few" causes that create the most problems.</li>
                        <li><strong>The SQA Plan is a Roadmap:</strong> A formal SQA Plan outlines all quality-related activities, standards, roles, and procedures for a project.</li>
