                        <p>Poor software quality is a persistent issue that affects nearly every organization using computers. It leads to lost productivity, corrupted data, high IT support costs, and low customer satisfaction. This problem often creates a cycle of blame:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Customers blame developers</strong> for sloppy practices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developers blame customers</strong> for irrational delivery dates and a continuous stream of changes.</li>

                    </div>
                     <div class="content-block">
                        <p>The concept of "quality" itself can be elusive, as famously described by Robert Pirsig in <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>: "Quality... you know what it is, yet you don‚Äôt know what it is."</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Defining Software Quality</h2>
                    <p>David Garvin of Harvard Business School suggests that quality is a multifaceted concept that can be viewed from five different perspectives.</p>
                    <h3>Garvin's Five Views on Quality</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transcendental View:</strong> Quality is something you immediately recognize but cannot explicitly define.</li>
                        <li><strong>User View:</strong> Quality is seen in terms of an end-user‚Äôs specific goals and fitness for purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manufacturer‚Äôs View:</strong> Quality is defined by conformance to the original specification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product View:</strong> Quality is tied to inherent characteristics of the product itself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Value-Based View:</strong> Quality is measured based on how much a customer is willing to pay for a product.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li><strong>Product Revision:</strong> The ease of modifying the software (Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability).</li>

                        <p><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> While this approach might work for large companies in certain domains, smaller companies must be cautious.

                        <li><strong>Design vs. Conformance:</strong> Software must be well-designed (Quality of Design) and implemented according to that design (Quality of Conformance). However, ultimate success depends on user satisfaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Costs of Quality:</strong> Quality is not free. It involves Prevention costs (planning), Appraisal costs (testing), and Failure costs (fixing bugs). It is almost always cheaper to prevent defects than to fix them after release.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risks of Poor Quality:</strong> Low-quality software leads to significant risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal liability, and reputational damage. Poor management decisions often directly contribute to low quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Achieving Quality (QA vs. QC):</strong> Quality is achieved through a combination of Quality Assurance (a proactive focus on the process) and Quality Control (a reactive focus on inspecting the product).</li>
