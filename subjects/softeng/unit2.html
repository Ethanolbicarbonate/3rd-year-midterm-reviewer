                        <p>The <strong>User Interface (<span class="term">UI</span>)</strong> is the visual part of an application through which a user interacts with the system. It focuses not just on usability but also on the overall look, style, and feel of the application.</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Menus:</strong> Provide a list of commands to select from, rather than typing them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pointing:</strong> A pointing device (like a mouse) is used to select items.</li>
                        <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Visual elements can be mixed with text on the same display.</li>

                            <p>Organize the user interface purposefully. This means being consistent, making elements recognizable, grouping related items, and separating unrelated ones. Similar things should look similar.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>User-Centered Design (UCD)</strong> is a process focused on user needs, involving empathy, iteration, user participation, and accessibility.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong> is the visual gateway to an application, with two main types: Text-Based (<span class="term">CLI</span>) and Graphical (<span class="term">GUI</span>).</li>
                        <li><span class="term">CLI</span> is powerful and customizable but requires users to recall commands. <span class="term">GUI</span> is intuitive and easy to navigate but can be less flexible.</li>
                        <li>The five key <strong>UI Design Principles</strong> are essential for creating effective and user-friendly interfaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structure</strong> ensures the UI is organized and consistent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> makes common tasks easy and communication clear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visibility</strong> ensures necessary options are always visible and accessible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback</strong> keeps the user informed about system status and actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tolerance</strong> minimizes the cost of user errors through features like "undo" and error prevention.</li>
