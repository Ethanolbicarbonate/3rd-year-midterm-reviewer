                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>A digital computer is a machine that executes a sequence of instructions, called a <strong>program</strong>. The most basic instructions a computer's electronic circuits can execute form its <strong>machine language</strong>. Because these languages are extremely simple and tedious for humans, computers are structured as a sequence of abstractions, or levels. This approach is called <strong>structured computer organization</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Each level builds upon the one below it, creating a more powerful and user-friendly environment. The higher levels are more abstract and easier for humans to work with, while the lower levels deal directly with hardware operations.</p>

                    <p>To bridge the gap between human-friendly languages (L1) and machine-friendly languages (L0), two primary methods are used to execute higher-level instructions.</p>

                            <h3>Translation</h3>
                            <p>The entire higher-level program (in language L1) is converted into an equivalent program in the machine's native language (L0). This new L0 program is then executed by the hardware. The program that performs this conversion is called a <strong>compiler</strong> or <strong>assembler</strong>.</p>

                            <p>A special program, called an <strong>interpreter</strong>, written in L0, takes the L1 program as input. It examines each L1 instruction one by one and executes the equivalent sequence of L0 instructions immediately. No new L0 program is generated.</p>

For example, a machine M1 with language L1 can be created, even if the physical hardware only understands L0. Programs written for this virtual machine can be either translated or interpreted to run on the real hardware (M0).</p>
