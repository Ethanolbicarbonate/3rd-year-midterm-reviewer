                    <h4>Bus Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>A mechanism needed to decide which device gets to be the bus master when multiple devices request the bus simultaneously. A common method is <span class="term">daisy chaining</span>, which grants access based on a device's physical proximity to the arbiter.</p>
