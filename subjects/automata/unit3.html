                    <h3>1. Value Creation</h3>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>Value creation is the foundation of any successful venture. It means your products and services must create tangible value for your customers. Importantly, value is defined by the customer‚Äîit is whatever they believe it to be.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> A clear statement explaining why customers should choose your product over others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Vision, passion, and the ability to adapt to customer needs and market trends.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>2. The Lean Startup</h3>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>Developed by Eric Ries, the Lean Startup is a scientific approach to creating and managing startups, aiming to get a desired product to customers faster. It is inspired by "lean manufacturing" techniques from Toyota.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-cards">

                            <h4>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h4>
                            <p>A basic version of a product presented to early customers to gather feedback. This feedback helps determine whether to <strong>pivot</strong> (change direction) or <strong>persevere</strong> (continue on the current path).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept">
                            <h4>Pivoting</h4>
                            <p>Realizing a business idea has no future and identifying a more successful direction based on customer feedback. It is not a failure, but a strategic shift.</p>
                        </div>

                        <strong>Principles of a Lean Startup:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Entrepreneurial Management:</strong> Uses the <strong>build-measure-learn feedback loop</strong> with iterative MVPs instead of complex plans.</li>
                            <li><strong>Validated Learning:</strong> Runs rigorous experiments (e.g., exposing customers to MVPs) to test each element of the business model.</li>
                            <li><strong>Innovation Accounting:</strong> Measures progress toward finding a scalable, repeatable business model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>3. Customer Discovery and Validation</h3>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>This is the primary focus during the startup phase. It involves understanding the customer and validating the business model before scaling.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Customer Discovery:</strong> Captures the founder's vision and turns it into a series of testable hypotheses about the customer problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Customer Validation:</strong> Tests whether the business model is <strong>repeatable</strong> (can consistently deliver value) and <strong>scalable</strong> (can handle a growing customer base).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>4. The Business Model Canvas</h3>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>Developed by Alexander Osterwalder, this is a powerful strategic management tool for technology entrepreneurs. A <strong>Business Model</strong> describes the logic by which an enterprise sustains itself financially. A successful model is both repeatable and scalable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>5. The Entrepreneurial Method</h3>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>A scientific approach to entrepreneurship, crucial for customer discovery and validation. It is guided by four core principles.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Design Thinking</h2>
                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>Design Thinking is a step-by-step, human-centered process for solving complex problems. It focuses on understanding people's needs, thinking creatively, and testing ideas before creating a final solution.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>The 5 Stages of Design Thinking</h3>
                    <div class="concept-cards">
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept"><h4>1. Empathize</h4><p>Gain a deep understanding of your users' needs and feelings. Methods include observing, engaging (talking), and immersing yourself in their situation.</p></div>
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept"><h4>2. Define</h4><p>Clearly state the problem based on your empathy findings. This involves synthesizing insights into an actionable problem statement or <strong>Point of View (POV)</strong>.</p></div>
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept"><h4>3. Ideate</h4><p>Generate a broad range of ideas and solutions. The focus is on quantity and diversity of ideas, not finding the single "right" one.</p></div>
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept"><h4>4. Prototype</h4><p>Bring ideas to life with low-resolution versions of solutions. Prototyping is for problem-solving ("build to think"), communicating ideas, and failing quickly and cheaply.</p></div>
                        <div class="concept-card primary-concept"><h4>5. Test</h4><p>Solicit feedback from real users on your prototypes to refine the solution and deepen your understanding of the user.</p></div>
