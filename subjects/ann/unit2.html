                    <div class="content-block info-block">
                        <p>A neural network consists of a group of interconnected neurons, where the output of one layer of neurons becomes the input for the next. The individual neurons are often referred to as <strong>nodes</strong>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="concept-card primary-concept">
                        <h3>Dense Layers (Fully Connected Layers)</h3>
                        <p>This is the most common type of layer in a neural network. It's called "dense" because every neuron in the current layer is connected to every neuron from the previous layer. This creates a dense web of connections, allowing the network to learn complex relationships between features.</p>

                    <h3>Handling Parameters with Matrices</h3>
                    <div class="content-block">
                        <p>For a single perceptron, vectors (lists) are sufficient for managing one set of weights and a bias. However, with hidden layers containing multiple neurons, the number of parameters grows rapidly. The most intuitive and efficient way to handle these multiple sets of weights and biases is with <strong>matrices</strong> (lists of lists or 2D arrays).</p>
                        <p>The forward pass through a dense layer can be expressed as a single matrix operation:</p>
                        \[ \mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{b} \]
                        <p>Where \(\mathbf{Z}\) is the vector of weighted sums for the layer, \(\mathbf{W}^T\) is the transposed matrix of weights, \(\mathbf{X}\) is the input vector, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the vector of biases.</p>

                        <p>Activation functions introduce <strong>non-linearity</strong> into the network. Without them, a neural network, no matter how many layers it has, would behave just like a simple linear regression model. This non-linearity allows the network to learn and model complex, real-world relationships in data.</p>

                            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The original activation for perceptrons. Rarely used now because its derivative is zero everywhere else, which prevents effective learning with backpropagation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Essentially no activation. Stacking layers with linear activation is equivalent to a single linear layer.</p>

                            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Squashes output to a range of (-1, 1). Its zero-centered output often makes it preferable to Sigmoid for hidden layers, but it also suffers from vanishing gradients.</p>

                            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A variation of ReLU that solves the dying ReLU problem by allowing a small, non-zero gradient (e.g., \(\alpha=0.01\)) for negative inputs.</p>

                        <p>For a model to "learn," it needs to know how wrong its predictions are. A <strong>loss function</strong> (or cost function) is an algorithm that quantifies this error by comparing the model's prediction to the true target value.
