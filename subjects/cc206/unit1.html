                    <h3>Native Application Development</h3>
                    <div class="content-block">
                        <p>A native app is developed <strong>exclusively for a single platform</strong> using a programming language native to that operating system.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>For Android:</strong> Java or Kotlin</li>
                            <li><strong>For iOS:</strong> Objective-C or Swift</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Native apps acquire all possible advantages of the device and its OS features. They have direct access to hardware like GPS, camera, and microphone, which results in high performance and a better user experience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Maps, Pinterest, Spotify.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Hybrid Application Development</h3>
                    <div class="content-block">
                         <p>Hybrid development combines native and web solutions. The core of the app is written using web technologies (<span class="term">HTML</span>, <span class="term">CSS</span>, <span class="term">JavaScript</span>) and then wrapped in a native container.</p>
                         <p>Plugins like <strong>Apache Cordova</strong> or <strong>Ionic's Capacitor</strong> are used to bridge the gap and provide access to native device functionalities. A hybrid app generally consists of two main components: a backend code and a native viewer (essentially a web browser within the app).</p>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Gmail, Uber, Apple App Store.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Cross-Platform Application Development</h3>
                    <div class="content-block">
                        <p>This approach allows developers to <strong>write code once and reuse it</strong> for different platforms. This significantly reduces development time and cost.</p>
                        <div class="note-block warning">
                           <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Hybrid vs. Cross-Platform:</strong> The only similarity between hybrid and cross-platform apps is "code shareability." The key difference lies in how they render elements and access native features, with cross-platform apps often compiling to native code for better performance than hybrid apps.
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Skype, Slack, Facebook, Instagram, Uber Eats.</p>
